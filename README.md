Loquax, (Latin for "chatty"), is an _**extensible**_ Python library for analyzing and manipulating phonology of endangered & extinct languages. It provides functionality for:

- **Syllabification:** Break down words into their fundamental phonetic components.
- **Phoneme Analysis:** Understand the unique sounds and their roles within words.
- **Morphological Transformations:** Observe and manipulate the structure of words.
- **IPA Transliteration:** Convert text into the International Phonetic Alphabet for universal comprehension.
- **Scansion:** Analyze the rhythm of verse in classical poetry, and syllable weight in general.
- **Extensibility:** Build and customize your own language rules for unique or theoretical languages.

Loquax is a zero-dependency tool, using functional style Python 3.10+ features to revive the sounds of the past, one phoneme at a time.
